                    <p>Our mission is to provide a place for people to have rich private conversations with the groups that matter to them. We want everyone to feel comfortable being their True selves on our Platform - just like they do in real life. But we understand that this type of comfort is only possible with the proper safety and privacy settings in place. Keeping our community safe is an everyday priority grounded on the safety principles&nbsp;below.</p>

                    <h2>You control who sees your content</h2>
                    <p>Our thoughtful <a href="#">user controls</a> let you decide who sees your content at all times. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Content in a thread stays in the thread</strong>
                            You can share with all your friends in your ‘Friends’ thread.  You can also share unique content with smaller groups in each of your custom threads.  
                            No one outside of any thread can see your content in a thread.</li>
                        <li><strong>Your content leaves with you</strong>
                            When you leave a thread, all of your past content is immediately removed from the thread too. You do not need to worry about any posts staying in conversations or threads where you are no longer active. And if you leave True, all of your data and content will be deleted from the app.</li>
                        <li><strong>No public broadcasting in private threads</strong>
                            When we say private conversations, we mean it.  In our private threaded experience, there is no way to share posts publicly beyond your thread.  You also cannot share content from one thread to another.  We want to encourage original content and minimize the spread of news, misinformation, or any type of sponsored content in private threads.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It’s that simple - you control your content without complicated privacy settings and user control features.</p>

                        Our <a href="#">community guidelines</a> outline the types of engagement that we support on True. We are in

                        But if you see content that you believe violates our <a href="#">community guidelines</a> or <a href="#">terms of service</a>, please <a href="#">report it</a>. We review all reports, and we will take 
                        serious action on any content or person that is reported multiple times. Actions may include a warning, account suspension, or permanent 
                        removal of the content or account. More details on
