                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <h2>Updated October 15, 2019</h2>
                <p>True is private sharing for real friends. We’re deeply committed to giving you a safe, happy place to share — a place where you’re never forced to sell your personal infor-mation to stay connected with people you love. </p>
                <p>Your trust is extremely important to us. That’s why we’ve attempted to write this privacy policy with as little legal jargon as possible. If something is still unclear, shoot us an email. We’ll be happy to answer any questions.</p>
                <p>If you’re in the U.S., all the information you need is in the first few pages of the docu-ment. If you’re in the EU, be sure to have a look at our GDPR section, too.</p>
                <p><strong>Our privacy policy in a nutshell:</strong> We’ll never share, sell or give your information to anyone outside True for the purpose of making money. You own your personal informa-tion and control how it’s accessed and used.</p>
                
                <h2>I) Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>True collects three types of information:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Information you give us</li>
                    <li>Information we get when you use True</li>
                    <li>Information we get from our service providers</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Here’s a little more detail.</p>
                <h2>1. Information you give us</h2>
                <p>When you interact with our services, we collect information you give us. For instance, we may collect your phone number when you create a True account. We also ask you to provide information that will be publicly visible on our platform, such as your name and profile picture. </p>
                <p>You also provide us with information that you post to a Thread or send to other users, such as photos, videos or direct messages. True is built so your content is only visible tothe people you’re posting to and can’t be shared outside of your message or Thread, but keep in mind that the people you share it with can still take a screenshot or copy it.</p>
                <p>When you contact support or communicate with us in any other way, we’ll collect what-ever information that you volunteer or need to help you out. </p>

                <h2>2. Information we get when you use True</h2>
                <p>When you use True, we collect information about how you’ve used our product and the features you’re using. We might know, for instance, that you watched a video, made a post or, if you opt-in to ads, if you clicked on them or not. Here’s a more in-depth explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Usage Information.</strong> We collect information about your activity through our services. For example, we may collect information about:
                        <ul>
                            <li>how you interact with our services, such as the editing you do on your photos or the stuff you search for. </li>
                            <li>how you communicate with friends on True, such as who they are, the time and date of your communications, how many messages you exchange with your friends, who you exchange messages with the most, and what Threads you post in most frequently. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Content Information.</strong> We collect content you create on our services, such as photos and videos, and information about the content you create or provide, such as if friends interacted with your content and the metadata that is provided with the content. </li>
                    <li><strong>Device Information.</strong> We collect information from and about the devices you use. For example, we collect:
                        <ul>
                            <li>information about your hardware and software, such as the hardware model, operating system version, device memory, unique application identifiers, apps installed, unique device identifiers, language, battery level, time zone, and — if you opt-in to advertising — advertising identifiers;</li>
                            <li>information from device sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, compasses, microphones, and whether you have headphones connected; and</li>
                            <li>information about your wireless and mobile network connections, such as mobile phone number, service provider, IP address, and signal strength.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Device Contact List.</strong> The purpose of True is to help you stay close with your friends. To help you do that, we may—with your permission—collect information from your device’s contact list.</li>
                    <li><strong>Camera and Photos.</strong> Many of our services require us to collect images and other information from your device’s camera and photos. For example, you won’t be able to take photos or upload photos from your camera roll unless we can access your camera or photos.</li>
                    <li><strong>Location Information.</strong> When you use our services we may collect information about your location. With your permission, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies.</strong> True does not collect any browser cookies from your web activities outside of our mobile application, except in the case of visitors to our website, trytrue.com. Even if you opt-in to personalized advertising on the True app, we do not use your activity on other websites to show you ads.<br />
                        For visitors to <a href="https://trytrue.com">trytrue.com</a>, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. This information tells us who is interested in True. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device.</li>
                    <li><strong>Log Information.</strong> We collect log information when you use our website, such as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>details about how you’ve used our services;</li>
                            <li>device information, such as your web browser type and language;</li>
                            <li>access times;</li>
                            <li>pages viewed;</li>
                            <li>IP address;</li>
                            <li>identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser; and</li>
                            <li>pages you visited before navigating to our website.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Information We Collect from Third Parties</h2>
                <p>Third parties do not have access to user data on True for the purpose of advertising or building applications. The only third parties that access the information you share with us or provide information about you are those that provide the technology to run the app. Here are some examples: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you link your True account to another service, such as Facebook, we will retrieve your friend list, profile picture and name in order to set up your profile and help you add Facebook friends who are already on True. </li>
                    <li>True uses Google Maps to provide location services. If you use Locations on True, we will exchange information with Google Maps in order to show your location to friends you have chosen to share it with. </li>
                    <li>If another user uploads their contact list, we may combine information from that user’s contact list with other information we have collected about you so you can easily friend them. </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>II) How We Use Information</h2>
                <p>What do we do with the information we collect? We use it in three ways:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>To run our service,</li>
                    <li>help us learn who is interested in True through our marketing website,</li>
                    <li>If you opt-in, to show you personalized ads. </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Some of the ways we use your information to run our service include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>to develop, operate, improve, deliver, maintain, and protect True.
                    <li>send you communications, including by email. For example, we may use email to respond to support inquiries or to share information about our products, services, and promotional offers that we think may interest you.</li>
                    <li>monitor and analyze trends and usage.</li>
                    <li>personalize your experience on True by suggesting friends, showing your profile information, or customizing the content we show you.</li>
                    <li>enhance the safety and security of our products and services.</li>
                    <li>enforce our Terms of Service and other usage policies and comply with legal requirements.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you visit our website, we’ll use the information we collect there to: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>see how you interact with content on our website.</li>
                    <li>monitor and analyze trends and usage.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you opt-in to see personalized ads on True, we’ll use your information to provide and improve our advertising services, ad targeting, and ad measurement, including through the use of your precise location information (again, if you’ve given us permission to collect that information). The information we collect for personalized advertising is limited to your activity on the app and does not include information about what you do on outside websites. </p>
                
                <h2>III) How We Share Information</h2>
                <p>We may share information about you in the following ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>With other users.</strong> We may share a limited amount of information with other users in order to help you make connections on True:
                    <ul>
                        <li>We may share information about you, such as your name and profile picture, with other users.</li>
                        <li>We may share information about how you have interacted with our services, such as the number of posts you have made and friends you have, with other users. We may also share the names of other True users you are friends with to help others understand your connections on True. For example, because it may not be clear if a new friend request comes from someone you actually know, we may share whether you and the requestor have friends in common.</li>
                        <li>We may share content you post or send with other users. Who all can see your content depends on the Threads you post it in. For example, a post may be seen by just a few friends if you post it in your Private Thread with those friends, or it may be seen by all of your friends if you post it in your Friends Thread.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>With technology partners.</strong> We may share information about you with service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as Google Maps. If you opt-in to ads, we may also share information that measures and optimizes the performance of ads and delivers more relevant ads to you within True.
                    <ul>
                        <li>We may share information about you with business partners that provide services and functionality on our services, such as Google Maps. </li>
                        <li>We may share information about you, such as device and usage information, to help us and others prevent fraud.</li>
                        <li>We may share information about you for legal, safety, and security reasons. We may share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:
                            <ul>
                                <li>comply with any valid legal process, governmental request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation.</li>
                                <li>investigate, remedy, or enforce potential Terms of Service violations.</li>
                                <li>protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our users, or others.</li>
                                <li>detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>We may share information about you as part of a merger or acquisition. If Hello Mobile Inc., the parent company of True, is involved in a merger, asset sale, financing, liquidation or bankruptcy, or acquisition of all or some portion of our business to another company, we may share your information with that company before and after the transaction closes.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>IV) How Long We Keep Your Information</h2>
                <p>On True, your information is removed from our system as soon as you delete it. This goes for everything you share on True, including posts, videos, photos and messages. When you delete them, you remove them immediately and there’s no way to retrieve them. The same goes for your profile — if you delete it, it’s gone for good. </p>
                <p>There may be cases where we have to keep your information longer. This includes legal requirements to store your data, in which case we may need to suspend our deletion practices if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve content or if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of Service violations. Finally, we may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law.</p>

                <h2>V) Control Over Your Information</h2>
                <p>On True, you own and control your personal information and how it is accessed and used. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Access and correction.</strong> You can access and edit your account information any time from inside the True app. To protect your privacy, we will ask you to verify your identity when you log in to True or if we suspect suspicious activity. We may also reject your request to access or update your personal information for a number of reasons, including, for example, if the request risks the privacy of other users or is unlawful.</li>
                    <li><strong>Revoking permissions.</strong> In most cases, if you let us access certain types of information — such as your location or photos in your gallery — you can revoke your permission by changing your settings in the app or on your device. Keep in mind that if you do this, features that require those permissions will stop working. </li>
                    <li><strong>Deletion.</strong> As noted above, you can delete your profile and any information from True at any time and it will be removed immediately, except when it is required by law that your information is retained. </li>
                    <li><strong>Communicating with other users.</strong> True is designed to give you complete control over what you share and who you share it with. If you create a Thread, you can remove other members of the Thread at any time. You can also remove yourself from a Thread, which will remove all of your content from that Thread so it is no longer visible to other users. You can also delete your content without removing yourself from a Thread. You also have the ability to block other users, which will prevent them from seeing your content even if you are in a Thread together.</li>              
                </ul>

                <h2>VI) GDPR</h2>
                <p>If you’re a user in the European Union, you should know that True is the controller of your personal information and abides by General Data Protection Regulation standards. Here is some information we would like to bring to your attention:</p>

                <h2>1. Rights of Access, Deletion, Correction, and Portability</h2>
                <p>You can exercise your rights of access, deletion, correction, and portability as described above.</p>
                
                <h2>2. Bases for Using Your Information</h2>
                <p>Your country only allows us to use your personal information when certain conditions apply. These conditions are called “legal bases” and, at True, we typically rely on one of three:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Legitimate interest.</strong> One reason we might use your information is because we have a legitimate interest in doing so. For instance, we need to use your information to provide and improve our services, including things like protecting your account, delivering your content, helping you find friends and providing customer support. Our interests don’t outweigh your right to privacy, so we only rely on legitimate interest when we think the way we are using your data doesn’t significantly impact your privacy or would be expected by you, or there is a compelling reason to do so. </li>
                    <li><strong>Consent.</strong> In some cases we’ll ask for consent to use your information for specific purposes, such as access to your camera and contact list. If we do, you will be able to revoke your consent in our services or through your device permissions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal obligation.</strong> We may be required to use your personal information to comply with the law, like when we respond to valid legal process or must take action to protect our users. We will notify you if we receive legal process seeking your account information, with some exceptions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Your Right to Object</h2>
                <p>You have the right to object to our use of your information. With many types of data, we’ve provided you with the ability to simply delete it if you don’t want us processing it anymore. For other types of data, we’ve given you the ability to stop the use of your data by disabling the feature altogether. You can do these things in the app. If there are other types of information you don’t agree with us processing, you can contact us.</p>
                <h2>4. International Transfers</h2>
                <p>We may collect your personal information from, transfer it to, and store and process it in the United States and other countries outside of where you live.</p>
                <p><strong>Complaints?</strong> If you’re based in the EU, you can always file a complaint with the supervisory authority in your Member State. For example, if you’re based in the UK, you can file a complaint with the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/" target="_blank">Information Commissioner’s Office</a>.</p>
            
                <h2>VII) Children</h2>
                <p>Our services are not intended for—and we don’t direct them to—anyone under 13 in the U.S. or under 16 in the EU. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13. In addition, we may limit how we collect, use, and store some of the information of EU users between 13 and 16. In some cases, this means certain functionalities will be limited.</p>
                <h2>VIII) Revisions to the Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>This Privacy Policy may change in the future. If it does, we’ll let you know either by changing the date at the top of the Privacy Policy that appears on our website and app; by sending you an in-app notification; or by adding a statement to our website.</p>
