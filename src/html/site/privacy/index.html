                                </ul>

                            <li><strong>Camera and Photos.</strong> Many of our services require us to collect images and other information from your device’s camera and photos. For example, you won’t be able to upload photos from your camera roll unless we can access your camera or photos.</li>
                            <li><strong>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies.</strong> Like most online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and device.

                            <li><strong>Technical data.</strong> In order to maintain the integrity of our systems and to monitor and improve their performance we collect technical information typically collected by websites and apps: device characteristics (including device ID for mobile devices), operating system, browser type, dates and times logged in, use statistics, metadata for images, etc.</li>

                            <li><strong>Aggregate and anonymized data.</strong> To better understand our users we may use de-identified/anonymized data and aggregate data through sources such as an IDFA and an AAID to enable us to gauge what parts of our products are popular and how they are used generally.</li>
                                
                            <li><strong>Contact Lists.</strong> To enable you to access your contacts from within the True app, you can sync your contact list to True.

We’ll never use your contact list for anything other than to provide a better user experience (we won’t contact them or sell or share the information on your contact list).</li>
