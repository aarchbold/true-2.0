                            These types of communications are known as "Operational Communications." In some cases,

Cookies are strings of text and numbers that can identify your computer to us when you visit the True Site. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password, and if you choose, to save other personal information so you do not have to reenter it each time you visit.

                            There are two types of cookies: session-based cookies and persistent-based cookies. Session-based cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent-based cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser. Standing alone, cookies do not contain personal data, and therefore do not identify you personally; they merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to us by using the True Site, you will remain anonymous to us.

Such third parties may use cookies to help track visitor behavior, including visitor
                            responsiveness to online advertisements. Such cookies will not be used to associate individual visitors with any personal data. Except as otherwise set forth in the end user license agreement, all data collected by such third parties on our behalf is used only to provide us with information on usage and will not be shared with any other third parties.
