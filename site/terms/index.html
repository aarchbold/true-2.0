                        <p>If you see anything on our site or app that you believe infringes your copyright rights, you may notify our Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") agent by sending the following information:</p>

(Please include your copyright registration number or a copy of the registration application for the work, as filed with the Copyright Office. A copyright infringement claim based on a U.S. work can only be filed if the work has been registered. Because a high percentage of DMCA takedown notices are not valid, we reserve the right to ignore DMCA notifications based on unregistered works.)</li>

                            <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by you as copyright owner, or by your agent, or by law.</li>
                            <li>A statement that the information in your notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the owner (or authorized to act on behalf of the owner) of the exclusive copyright right that is allegedly being infringed.</li>
                            <li>Your physical or electronic signature, or that of someone authorized to act on your behalf.</li>

We may revise these terms from time to time; whenever we do so, we will indicate this by changing the version number and date at the top, and we will also notify you via your user account. Any changes apply as of the time they are posted.
