                    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                    <h2>Updated October 15, 2019</h2>
                    <p>True is private sharing for real friends. We’re deeply committed to giving you a safe, happy place to share — a place where you’re never forced to sell your personal infor-mation to stay connected with people you love. </p>
                    <p>Your trust is extremely important to us. That’s why we’ve attempted to write this privacy policy with as little legal jargon as possible. If something is still unclear, shoot us an email. We’ll be happy to answer any questions.</p>
                    <p>If you’re in the U.S., all the information you need is in the first few pages of the docu-ment. If you’re in the EU, be sure to have a look at our GDPR section, too.</p>
                    <p><strong>Our privacy policy in a nutshell:</strong> We’ll never share, sell or give your information to anyone outside True for the purpose of making money. You own your personal informa-tion and control how it’s accessed and used.</p>
                    
                    <h2>I) Information We Collect</h2>
                    <p>True collects three types of information:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Information you give us</li>
                        <li>Information we get when you use True</li>
                        <li>Information we get from our service providers</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Here’s a little more detail.</p>
                    <h2>1. Information you give us</h2>
                    <p>When you interact with our services, we collect information you give us. For instance, we may collect your phone number when you create a True account. We also ask you to provide information that will be publicly visible on our platform, such as your name and profile picture. </p>
                    <p>You also provide us with information that you post to a Thread or send to other users, such as photos, videos or direct messages. True is built so your content is only visible tothe people you’re posting to and can’t be shared outside of your message or Thread, but keep in mind that the people you share it with can still take a screenshot or copy it.</p>
                    <p>When you contact support or communicate with us in any other way, we’ll collect what-ever information that you volunteer or need to help you out. </p>

                    <h2>2. Information we get when you use True</h2>
                    <p>When you use True, we collect information about how you’ve used our product and the features you’re using. We might know, for instance, that you watched a video, made a post or, if you opt-in to ads, if you clicked on them or not. Here’s a more in-depth explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Usage Information.</strong> We collect information about your activity through our services. For example, we may collect information about:
                            <ul>
                                <li>how you interact with our services, such as the editing you do on your photos or the stuff you search for. </li>
                                <li>how you communicate with friends on True, such as who they are, the time and date of your communications, how many messages you exchange with your friends, who you exchange messages with the most, and what Threads you post in most frequently. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Content Information.</strong> We collect content you create on our services, such as photos and videos, and information about the content you create or provide, such as if friends interacted with your content and the metadata that is provided with the content. </li>
                        <li><strong>Device Information.</strong> We collect information from and about the devices you use. For example, we collect:
                            <ul>
                                <li>information about your hardware and software, such as the hardware model, operating system version, device memory, unique application identifiers, apps installed, unique device identifiers, language, battery level, time zone, and — if you opt-in to advertising — advertising identifiers;</li>
                                <li>information from device sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, compasses, microphones, and whether you have headphones connected; and</li>
                                <li>information about your wireless and mobile network connections, such as mobile phone number, service provider, IP address, and signal strength.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Device Contact List.</strong> The purpose of True is to help you stay close with your friends. To help you do that, we may—with your permission—collect information from your device’s contact list.</li>
                        <li><strong>Camera and Photos.</strong> Many of our services require us to collect images and other information from your device’s camera and photos. For example, you won’t be able to take photos or upload photos from your camera roll unless we can access your camera or photos.</li>
                        <li><strong>Location Information.</strong> When you use our services we may collect information about your location. With your permission, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.</li>
                        <li><strong>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies.</strong> True does not collect any browser cookies from your web activities outside of our mobile application, except in the case of visitors to our website, trytrue.com. Even if you opt-in to personalized advertising on the True app, we do not use your activity on other websites to show you ads.<br />
                            For visitors to <a href="https://trytrue.com">trytrue.com</a>, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. This information tells us who is interested in True. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device.</li>
                        <li><strong>Log Information.</strong> We collect log information when you use our website, such as:
                            <ul>
                                <li>details about how you’ve used our services;</li>
                                <li>device information, such as your web browser type and language;</li>
                                <li>access times;</li>
                                <li>pages viewed;</li>
                                <li>IP address;</li>
                                <li>identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser; and</li>
                                <li>pages you visited before navigating to our website.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>3. Information We Collect from Third Parties</h2>
                    <p>Third parties do not have access to user data on True for the purpose of advertising or building applications. The only third parties that access the information you share with us or provide information about you are those that provide the technology to run the app. Here are some examples: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you link your True account to another service, such as Facebook, we will retrieve your friend list, profile picture and name in order to set up your profile and help you add Facebook friends who are already on True. </li>
                        <li>True uses Google Maps to provide location services. If you use Locations on True, we will exchange information with Google Maps in order to show your location to friends you have chosen to share it with. </li>
                        <li>If another user uploads their contact list, we may combine information from that user’s contact list with other information we have collected about you so you can easily friend them. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>II) How We Use Information</h2>
                    <p>What do we do with the information we collect? We use it in three ways:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>To run our service,</li>
                        <li>help us learn who is interested in True through our marketing website,</li>
                        <li>If you opt-in, to show you personalized ads. </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Some of the ways we use your information to run our service include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>to develop, operate, improve, deliver, maintain, and protect True.
                        <li>send you communications, including by email. For example, we may use email to respond to support inquiries or to share information about our products, services, and promotional offers that we think may interest you.</li>
                        <li>monitor and analyze trends and usage.</li>
                        <li>personalize your experience on True by suggesting friends, showing your profile information, or customizing the content we show you.</li>
                        <li>enhance the safety and security of our products and services.</li>
                        <li>enforce our Terms of Service and other usage policies and comply with legal requirements.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If you visit our website, we’ll use the information we collect there to: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>see how you interact with content on our website.</li>
                        <li>monitor and analyze trends and usage.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you opt-in to see personalized ads on True, we’ll use your information to provide and improve our advertising services, ad targeting, and ad measurement, including through the use of your precise location information (again, if you’ve given us permission to collect that information). The information we collect for personalized advertising is limited to your activity on the app and does not include information about what you do on outside websites. </p>
                    
                    <h2>III) How We Share Information</h2>
                    <p>We may share information about you in the following ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>With other users.</strong> We may share a limited amount of information with other users in order to help you make connections on True:
                        <ul>
                            <li>We may share information about you, such as your name and profile picture, with other users.</li>
                            <li>We may share information about how you have interacted with our services, such as the number of posts you have made and friends you have, with other users. We may also share the names of other True users you are friends with to help others understand your connections on True. For example, because it may not be clear if a new friend request comes from someone you actually know, we may share whether you and the requestor have friends in common.</li>
                            <li>We may share content you post or send with other users. Who all can see your content depends on the Threads you post it in. For example, a post may be seen by just a few friends if you post it in your Private Thread with those friends, or it may be seen by all of your friends if you post it in your Friends Thread.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>With technology partners.</strong> We may share information about you with service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as Google Maps. If you opt-in to ads, we may also share information that measures and optimizes the performance of ads and delivers more relevant ads to you within True.
                        <ul>
                            <li>We may share information about you with business partners that provide services and functionality on our services, such as Google Maps. </li>
                            <li>We may share information about you, such as device and usage information, to help us and others prevent fraud.</li>
                            <li>We may share information about you for legal, safety, and security reasons. We may share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>comply with any valid legal process, governmental request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation.</li>
                                    <li>investigate, remedy, or enforce potential Terms of Service violations.</li>
                                    <li>protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our users, or others.</li>
                                    <li>detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>We may share information about you as part of a merger or acquisition. If Hello Mobile Inc., the parent company of True, is involved in a merger, asset sale, financing, liquidation or bankruptcy, or acquisition of all or some portion of our business to another company, we may share your information with that company before and after the transaction closes.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>IV) How Long We Keep Your Information</h2>
                    <p>On True, your information is removed from our system as soon as you delete it. This goes for everything you share on True, including posts, videos, photos and messages. When you delete them, you remove them immediately and there’s no way to retrieve them. The same goes for your profile — if you delete it, it’s gone for good. </p>
                    <p>There may be cases where we have to keep your information longer. This includes legal requirements to store your data, in which case we may need to suspend our deletion practices if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve content or if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of Service violations. Finally, we may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law.</p>

                    <h2>V) Control Over Your Information</h2>
                    <p>On True, you own and control your personal information and how it is accessed and used. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Access and correction.</strong> You can access and edit your account information any time from inside the True app. To protect your privacy, we will ask you to verify your identity when you log in to True or if we suspect suspicious activity. We may also reject your request to access or update your personal information for a number of reasons, including, for example, if the request risks the privacy of other users or is unlawful.</li>
                        <li><strong>Revoking permissions.</strong> In most cases, if you let us access certain types of information — such as your location or photos in your gallery — you can revoke your permission by changing your settings in the app or on your device. Keep in mind that if you do this, features that require those permissions will stop working. </li>
                        <li><strong>Deletion.</strong> As noted above, you can delete your profile and any information from True at any time and it will be removed immediately, except when it is required by law that your information is retained. </li>
                        <li><strong>Communicating with other users.</strong> True is designed to give you complete control over what you share and who you share it with. If you create a Thread, you can remove other members of the Thread at any time. You can also remove yourself from a Thread, which will remove all of your content from that Thread so it is no longer visible to other users. You can also delete your content without removing yourself from a Thread. You also have the ability to block other users, which will prevent them from seeing your content even if you are in a Thread together.</li>              
                    </ul>

                    <h2>VI) GDPR</h2>
                    <p>If you’re a user in the European Union, you should know that True is the controller of your personal information and abides by General Data Protection Regulation standards. Here is some information we would like to bring to your attention:</p>

                    <h2>1. Rights of Access, Deletion, Correction, and Portability</h2>
                    <p>You can exercise your rights of access, deletion, correction, and portability as described above.</p>
                    
                    <h2>2. Bases for Using Your Information</h2>
                    <p>Your country only allows us to use your personal information when certain conditions apply. These conditions are called “legal bases” and, at True, we typically rely on one of three:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Legitimate interest.</strong> One reason we might use your information is because we have a legitimate interest in doing so. For instance, we need to use your information to provide and improve our services, including things like protecting your account, delivering your content, helping you find friends and providing customer support. Our interests don’t outweigh your right to privacy, so we only rely on legitimate interest when we think the way we are using your data doesn’t significantly impact your privacy or would be expected by you, or there is a compelling reason to do so. </li>
                        <li><strong>Consent.</strong> In some cases we’ll ask for consent to use your information for specific purposes, such as access to your camera and contact list. If we do, you will be able to revoke your consent in our services or through your device permissions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legal obligation.</strong> We may be required to use your personal information to comply with the law, like when we respond to valid legal process or must take action to protect our users. We will notify you if we receive legal process seeking your account information, with some exceptions.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>3. Your Right to Object</h2>
                    <p>You have the right to object to our use of your information. With many types of data, we’ve provided you with the ability to simply delete it if you don’t want us processing it anymore. For other types of data, we’ve given you the ability to stop the use of your data by disabling the feature altogether. You can do these things in the app. If there are other types of information you don’t agree with us processing, you can contact us.</p>
                    <h2>4. International Transfers</h2>
                    <p>We may collect your personal information from, transfer it to, and store and process it in the United States and other countries outside of where you live.</p>
                    <p><strong>Complaints?</strong> If you’re based in the EU, you can always file a complaint with the supervisory authority in your Member State. For example, if you’re based in the UK, you can file a complaint with the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/" target="_blank">Information Commissioner’s Office</a>.</p>
                
                    <h2>VII) Children</h2>
                    <p>Our services are not intended for—and we don’t direct them to—anyone under 13 in the U.S. or under 16 in the EU. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13. In addition, we may limit how we collect, use, and store some of the information of EU users between 13 and 16. In some cases, this means certain functionalities will be limited.</p>
                    <h2>VIII) Revisions to the Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy may change in the future. If it does, we’ll let you know either by changing the date at the top of the Privacy Policy that appears on our website and app; by sending you an in-app notification; or by adding a statement to our website.</p>

As between True and Apple, any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of True. </li>

                                        <li>You and True acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of that App Store Sourced Application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, as between True and Apple, True, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by this Agreement. </li>
                                        <li>You and True acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof. </li>

                                        <li>Google is only a provider of Google Play where you obtained the Google Play Sourced Application. </li>
                                        <li>True, and not Google, is solely responsible for its Google Play Sourced Application;</li>
                                        <li>Google has no obligation or liability to you with respect to True’s Google Play Sourced Application or this Agreement; and</li>

                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Payment</strong>.  If you subscribe to any Service or make any other purchases within the Application (individually, an <strong>“In-App Purchase”</strong> and collectively, <strong>“In-App Purchases”</strong>), you acknowledge and agree: (a) to pay all fees or charges associated with such In-App Purchases in accordance with any and all applicable terms whether imposed by True or the App Store at the time a fee or charge is due and payable; (b) to provide accurate, current and complete payment information in connection with such In-App Purchases; (c) that True may retain any such payment information, including, but not limited to all debit and credit card information provided in connection with any In-App Purchase; and (d) that you will be charged for all fees and charges due and payable for any In-App Purchases hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required to use the payment information you provide.

You will be responsible for payment of the applicable fee for any Services (each, a <strong>“Service Subscription Fee”</strong>) at the time you create your Account and select your subscription (each, a <strong>“Service Commencement Date”</strong>). Except as set forth in the Agreement, all fees for the Services are non-refundable.  No contract will exist between you and True for the Services until True accepts your order by a confirmatory e-mail or other appropriate means of communication.</li>
                                <li><strong>Taxes</strong>.  True’s fees are net of any applicable Sales Tax.  If any Services, or payments for any Services, under the Terms are subject to Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to True, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify True for any liability or expense we may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes.  Upon our request, you will provide us with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes.  For purposes of this section, <strong>“Sales Tax”</strong> shall mean any sales or use tax, and any other tax measured by sales proceeds, that True is permitted to pass to its customers, that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.</li>
                                <li><strong>utomatic Renewal</strong>.  Your subscription will continue indefinitely until terminated in accordance with the Agreement.  <strong>After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically commence on the first day following the end of such period (each, a “Renewal Commencement Date”) and continue for an additional equivalent period, at True’s then-current price for such subscription.  You agree that your Account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature unless you cancel your subscription at least thirty (30) days prior to the Renewal Commencement Date (or in the event that you receive a notice from True that your subscription will be automatically renewed, you will have thirty days from the date of the True notice)</strong>.  If you do not wish your Account to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, please contact True at [INSERT EMAIL].  If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires.  However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. Upon renewal of your subscription, if True does not receive payment from your payment provider through the App Store as described herein, you agree that True may either terminate or suspend your subscription, and continue to attempt to charge your payment provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment through the App Store, your Account will be activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received).</li>
                                <li><strong>Free Trials and Other Promotions</strong>.  Any free trial or other promotion that provides a User access to the Services must be used within the specified time of the trial.  At the end of the trial period, your use of that Service will expire and any further use of the Service is prohibited unless you pay the applicable subscription fee. If you are inadvertently charged for a subscription, please contact True to have the charges reversed.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Indemnification</strong>. You agree to indemnify and hold True, its corporate parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and the officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners and licensors of each (collectively, the <strong>“True Indemnitees”</strong>) harmless from any damages, losses, costs, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) relating to or arising out of any claims concerning: (a) Your Content; (b) your misuse of the Services; (c) your violation of this Agreement; (d) your violation of any rights of another party, including any Users; or (e) your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations. True reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with True in asserting any available defenses. This provision does not require you to indemnify any of the True Indemnitees for any unconscionable commercial practice by such party or for such party's negligence, fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation or concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact. You agree that the provisions in this section will survive any termination of your Account, this Agreement or your access to the Services. </li>

                                <li><strong>Cap on Liability</strong>.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE TOTAL AGGREGATE AMOUNT THAT THE TRUE INDEMNITEES ARE LIABLE TO YOU EXCEED THE LESSER OF (A) THE TOTAL AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID TO TRUE BY YOU DURING THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE ACT, OMISSION OR OCCURRENCE GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY, (B) THE REMEDY OR PENALTY IMPOSED BY THE STATUTE OR REGULATION UNDER WHICH SUCH CLAIM ARISES, OR (C) ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). </li>

                                <li><strong>Exclusions</strong>. THE LAWS OF SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW FOR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES.

                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Termination</strong>.  At its sole discretion, True may modify or discontinue the Services, or may modify, suspend or terminate your access to the Services, for any reason, with or without notice to you and without liability to you or any third party. In addition to suspending or terminating your access to the Services, True reserves the right to take appropriate legal action, including without limitation pursuing civil, criminal or injunctive redress. Even after your right to use the Services is terminated, this Agreement will remain enforceable against you and unpaid amounts you owe to True will remain due. Upon termination of this Agreement, all provisions which by their nature are intended to survive termination will survive, including without limitation, Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14.</li>
                        <li><strong>International Users</strong>. The Services are controlled and offered by True from its facilities in the United States of America. True makes no representations that the Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Services from other countries do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong>.  <strong><em>Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully.  It requires you to arbitrate disputes with True, its parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns and all of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives (collectively, the “True Parties”) and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from the True Parties. </em></strong>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement</strong>. You agree that any dispute between you and any of the True Parties relating in any way to the Services or this Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you and the True Parties may assert individualized claims in small claims court if the claims qualify, remain in such court and advance solely on an individual, non-class basis; and (2) you or the True Parties may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). <strong>This Arbitration Agreement shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement and shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement</strong>. This Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies.  Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against the True Parties on your behalf.  </li>
                                <li><strong>Arbitration Rules and Forum</strong>. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to [INSERT ADDRESS OF REGISTERED AGENT]. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims with an amount in controversy under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’ most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/" target="_blank">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</a>; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/" target="_blank">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/</a>. JAMS’s rules are also available at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com" target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and you cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, True will pay them for you.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the U.S. county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Authority of Arbitrator</strong>. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes subject to arbitration hereunder including, without limitation, any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement and any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the True Parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual party under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the True Parties. </li>
                        <li><strong>Waiver of Jury Trial</strong>. EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED in section 13.1, YOU AND THE TRUE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and the True Parties are instead electing that all covered claims and disputes shall be resolved exclusively by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 13.1 above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review. </li>
                        <li><strong>Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief</strong>.  BY ENTERING INTO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU AND EACH OF THE TRUE PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION UNDER THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE FOR CLAIMS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION UNDER THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, AND CLAIMS OF ONE USER OR PERSON CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH CLAIMS OF ANY OTHER USER OR PERSON. If applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this Section 13.5’s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then the applicable claim must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought into the state or federal courts located in California in accordance with Section 14.5.  All other claims shall be arbitrated. </li>
                        <li><strong>30-Day Right to Opt Out</strong>.  You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending a timely written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: [INSERT ADDRESS] or email to [INSERT EMAIL], within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have with us, or may enter into in the future with us. </li>
                        <li><strong>Survival of Agreement</strong>.  This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination or expiration of the Agreement or your relationship with True.</li>
                        <li><strong>Modification</strong>. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if True makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing True at the following address: [INSERT ADDRESS]. </li>
                    </ol>

                            <li><strong>Electronic Communications</strong>. The communications between you and True use electronic means, whether you visit the Services or send True e-mails, or whether True posts notices on the Services or communicates with you via e-mail. For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from True in an electronic form; and (2) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications and documents that True provides to you electronically will have the same legal effect that such communications or documents would have if they were set forth in “writing.” The foregoing sentence does not affect your statutory rights. </li>
                            <li><strong>Assignment</strong>. This Agreement, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated or otherwise transferred by you without True’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. </li>
                            <li><strong>Force Majeure</strong>. True shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.</li>

                            <li><strong>Exclusive Venue</strong>. To the extent the parties are permitted under this Agreement to initiate litigation in a court, both you and True agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement that are not brought in a small claims court pursuant to Section 13.1 will be litigated exclusively in the state courts in San Francisco County, California or federal courts located in the Northern District of California. </li>
                            <li><strong>Governing Law</strong>.  THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY ACTION RELATED THERETO WILL BE GOVERNED AND INTERPRETED BY AND UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CONFLICT OF LAW OR OTHER PRINCIPLES THAT PROVIDE FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION. THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS DOES NOT APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT. </li>
                            <li><strong>Notice</strong>. Where True requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for providing True with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to True is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/permitted by this Agreement, True’s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice. You may give notice to True at the following address: [INSERT ADDRESS]. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by True by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address. </li>
