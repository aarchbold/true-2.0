                        <p>True has been designed to protect your privacy with private, threaded, beautiful sharing. We’re making social a safe, happy place again without personal data mining.</p>
    
                        <p>Social media shouldn’t be creepy and it doesn’t have to be.</p>
    
                        <ul>
                            <li>Focused on people you really know, True is real friends and real life without commercial interruption</li>
                            <li>It’s the quality of relationships, not quantity, that make us happier. We’re building new ways to tell your story and strengthen your community</li>
                            <li>We don’t spy on you, read your cookies or follow you around the internet. You own your data, forever, and we’ll never sell or share it with anyone</li>
                        </ul>
    
                        <p>It’s time to try an honest solution. We’re thrilled to get you back to things that matter.</p>
    
                        <p>The True Story</p>
    
                        <p>True was founded in a lovely little mountain town filled with giant redwoods, beautiful valleys and neighbors who look after each other.</p>
    
                        <p>It’s this real-life Happy Valley that inspired us to build a company that gets back to things that matter. Real friends and real life without commercial interruption.</p>
    
                        <p>It’s the quality of our relationships, not the quantity, that make us happier. It’s the joy of making new friends and connecting with old ones that strengthen our sense of community.</p>
    
                        <p>Somehow, in a rush for growth and profit, these feelings have been lost. Social today no longer feels like a Happy Valley, it’s more like we’re all living in a big creepy commercial.</p>
    
                        <p>Big social companies are in the middle of our relationships. They’re taking our best intentions and selling them to the highest bidder.</p>
    
                        <p>Well, we’re just not going to do that anymore.</p>
    
                        <p>Why Should I Trust You Guys?</p>
    
                        <p>There’s a lot of talk about privacy. Every few weeks, another big company gets caught in a new scandal. But there is never anything really done about it and we go on accepting the problem.</p>
    
                        <p>The crazy thing is, this is never going to stop. As long as these companies make money by selling our personal information, they will find ever more devious ways to collect it.</p>
    
                        <p>But we never signed up for this. We didn’t post our lives, families and personal relationships for sale. We did not agree to let these companies make money from being in the middle of our friendships.</p>
    
                        <p>We believe you should be free to share your life without big brands competing for your attention. You should own your information and decide what you want to do with it. 3rd parties should never have access to your data. You should not be the product.</p>
    
                        <p>We believe your privacy matters. We take it into consideration with every decision we make. You should believe we respect your privacy and trust we’ll do the right thing with your information.</p>
    
                        <p> What’s Different About It?</p>
    
                        <p>We just don’t think you can be yourself in a world of perfect pictures awash in a sea of influencers. Old-school social is for blasting your life to people you don’t really know, measured by standards you will never achieve.</p>
    
                        <p>So we’ve built a new kind of threaded sharing that is private by default. Until now, no one has tried this before. It gives you control over things you want to share and who you want to share them with.</p>
    
                        <p>By combining beautiful, edge-to-edge storytelling with private messaging, it’s the best of both worlds.</p>
    
                        <p>What do we all love? Updates from real friends. But original thoughts and stories have gone missing in big social.</p>
    
                        <p>Sadly, most content today is created by companies with an agenda. We share an endless stream of news and ideas pushed by these companies and no longer share our real lives.</p>
    
                        <p>So we built a platform that only allows original content. There are no outside links or political arguments here. You come to True to see real updates from friends. Content they created themselves, not clickbait designed to hold your attention and manipulate opinion.</p>
    
                        <p>True lets you… be you. Real sharing from real friends, we’re making social a safe, happy place again.</p>
